# jupyterlab_practice
This repository is related to an assignment for practice working with JupyterLab. It contains the JupyterLab notebook file for the assignment (assignment_07.ipynb), as well as notebook files for separate assignment questions. It also contains image files that demonstrate that competencies with using markdown formatting and other features of JupyterLab were mastered.
